# Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

A simple cryptocurrency, Proof of Work, Smart Contracts

This repository contains the solutions for the assignments from the 'Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies' course (ECE579) taken at Worcester Polytechnic Institute - WPI in the Spring 2020. 

This repository contains 3 projects, namely:

1. Scrooge Coin - this project is aimed to create Scroogecoin, a blockchain based cryptocurrency.
2. Proof of Work - this project implements the Proof of Work (PoW) functionality for a given blockchain application. The implementation adjusts the difficulty of the PoW to match a given time interval, for instance, if the time interval is given as 5 seconds, the creation of a new block should be around 5 seconds.
3. Smart Contracts - this project implements an auction application using Ethereum Smart Contracts.

Projects 1 and 2 are coded in Python and designed as Jupyter notebooks. Also, .py files are available for these projects.</br>
Project 3 is written in Solidity. The code was deployed and tested on Remix website [http://remix.ethereum.org].

More details on the projects are contained in the description files located in the corresponding subfolders.
